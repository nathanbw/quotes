"But one sometimes loses patience" well, this is the distraction of this prayer, and you must try to regain it, and to get calm with the thought that God wills or permits what upsets you, and causes you pain; but above all take great care not to lose your temper at feeling impatient, or to get worried at being upset.

'But this will prevent me from feeling contrite.' The efficacy of contrition is not in the feeling of it, it is entirely in the higher part of the soul--in the will. Sensible contrition very frequently serves only as food for self-love and can never be reassuring, since it is not what God requires. 'But supposing I have no contrition of the will?' You should believe and hope firmly that God has given it to you; but if you should only have had contrition once after having already confessed your sins it would be enough to remit them all, both past and present sins, so great is the mercy of God.

Love isn't just patient, not just kind. It's an act of will! One decides to love. Love is a choice! One chooses to love. Love requires sacrifice, by definition. It is not an act of love if it is not an act of sacrifice! Love brings with it obligation. The most obligation most folks have these days is their cell phone contracts. How sad. No wonder marriages don't last! Marriage is the hardest vocation. As a priest, you have to learn to deal with your own demons, but it's just you. You are your own worst enemy, but at the end of the day, it's just you. Religious life is like frat life that never ends. And marriage, marriage is hard. You have to sacrifice your hopes, your dreams, your desires for their hopes, their dreams, their desires.

We must not imagine that those whose virtue is shown in wonderful and singular ways, and by unquestionable attractions and inspirations, advance less on that account in the way of abandonment. From the moment that these acts become duties by the will of God, then to be content only to fulfil the duties of a state of life, or the ordinary inspirations of Providence would be to resist God, whose holy will would no longer retain the mastery of the passing moments, and to cease practising the virtue of abandonment.
